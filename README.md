# mocha-qtest-mapping-reporter
Mocha qTest reporter.  
Map your test cases to automated tests with tag _@qTest[testCaseId]_

## We assume that

* you want to have test suites with single test run per test case.
* you want to map mocha test(s) to test case in qTest
* ideally mapping is 1 to 1 to avoid execution result overwriting

**qTest Structure**
```
Test Suite  [testSuiteId]
  Test Run -> Test Case [testCaseId]
  Test Run -> Test Case [testCaseId]
  ...
```

**Mocha Test**
```
describe('Component')
  describe('Feature')
    it('test or test step @qTest[testCaseId]')
```

## How it works

Before test execution is started reporter either gets Test Runs of Test Suite or creates empty Test Suite.

Having Test Runs reporter can build mapping like: { testCaseId: testRunId }  
Test Run may be created automatically (by default) if Test Run for a Test Case is missing in Test Suite

Assuming test has string like @qTest[123456] in name, reporter uploads mocha test results in the end.

## Configuration

example config file
```
{
  "host": "...", // your qTest host
  "bearerToken": "********-****-****-****-************", // can be found in resources
  "projectId": "12345", // your project id
  "statePassed": "PASS", // can be found in automation settings -> integration*\
  "stateFailed": "FAIL", // can be found in automation settings -> integration*
  "enableLogs": false, // disables console logging. Default value: true.*
  "hideWarning": true, // hides "results won't be published" message. Default value: false.
  "hideResultUrl": true // skip printing out of suite url in the end. Default value: false.
  "attachmentTrigger": "ALL" // send attachments depending on test state. Default value === value of stateFailed. Special option - "ALL"
  "attachmentFolder": "cypress/screenshots" // path to attachments. Default value: report/screenshot
  "attachmentType": "image/png" // media type of attachments. More info https://www.iana.org/assignments/media-types/media-types.xhtml
}
```
you can pass options one by one or pass path to json like this:  
`--reporter-options configFile=config/qTestReporter.json`

## Environment variables

You can either use existing Test Suite or create new one

### Using Existing Test Suite *(useful for combined test executions, ex: manual + automated)*

`QTEST_SUITE_ID` - testSuiteId. **Required**

### Creating Test Suite

`QTEST_PARENT_TYPE` - one of *root / release / test-cycle / test-suite*. **Required**  
`QTEST_PARENT_ID` - parent id. Set to 0 if parent is root. **Required**  
`QTEST_SUITE_NAME` - Test Suite name. **Required**

### Common

`QTEST_BUILD_URL` - url to your build system or any other url. *Optional*  
`QTEST_CREATE_TEST_RUNS` - specify if test runs have to be created in qTest or just update existing ones. *Optional*

### Attachments

Reporter can attach files to a test runs.
Default trigger to send attachment - failed test.
By default it send files with full test.title included in filename from folder *report/screenshot* (+ search in subfolders) with media type [image/png].

Attachment folder / media type / trigger can be configured in config file.

## FAQ

**Q**: What is testCaseId, testRunId, testSuiteId  
**A**: this is object id that can be found in URL. It is **not** what you see in UI like (TC-XXX, TR-XXX, TS-XXX)

**Q**: What QTEST_SUITE_ID value should I pass if I want it to be created automatically?  
**A**: Don't pass any value.  
You may specify either QTEST_SUITE_ID or combination of QTEST_PARENT_TYPE, QTEST_PARENT_ID, QTEST_SUITE_NAME

**Q**: Reporter completes successfully but (some) results are missing  
**A**: some test runners (like Cypress) are not waiting for reporter to publish results.  
Add one more test in the very end that waits for 5-10 seconds. Also make sure that: your test cases are approved, user has sufficient privileges, test statuses have proper mapping (in automation settings), etc.
